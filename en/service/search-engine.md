# Search Engine and YaCy Instance

## Search Engine SearXNG

We have deployed a SearXNG instance in DN42, accessible at [Baaka.DN42](https://baaka.dn42/).

You can use this search engine to search for web pages and media within the DN42 network.

Currently, SearXNG fetches search results from the following data sources:
 - YaCy.Baka.DN42

### YaCy

We have deployed a YaCy node in DN42, accessible at [YaCy.Baka.DN42](https://yacy.baka.dn42/).

This YaCy instance is only used for crawling and indexing web pages and media content within the DN42 network, and is only accessible to users within the DN42 network.

Unfortunately, since YaCy is only a transitional solution, you cannot peer with this YaCy node to share crawled data or use it as your data source.
